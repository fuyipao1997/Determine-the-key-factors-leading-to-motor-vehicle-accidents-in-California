# Determine the key factors leading to motor vehicle accidents in California
## <b> 1. Project Objective</b>
Our main goal is to determine key factors that lead to fatal traffic accidents in California, based on multiple metrics in the historical data, including the weather condition, day of the week, road type, etc. To achieve this, we will apply explorative techniques in Google Bigquery and build an regression machine learning model. Using the results to the interests of the government and the driving community, providing evidence in areas that need to be improved, suggesting actions that could better alleviate accidents and enhance overall road safety.
## <b> 2. Report Summary</b>
Our project was carried out in three consecutive phases. In Phase I we conducted general exploratory analysis on the accidents that took place in 2020 for the top 10 populous states in the US, with four different areas as the external factors: road type, environment,time and fatality, to find out the general trend of the occurred accidents. Based on that, in Phase II, we included the usage of drug and alcohol as internal factors and combined them with the factors from Phase I for a deeper analysis. Providing insights for the stakeholders about the traffic accident fatality number and fatality rate.

In addition to Phase I & II, we established and refined a machine learning model (linear regression) in Phase III to further dig into the root causes of fatality and fatality rate, while also confirming the findings from previous phases
